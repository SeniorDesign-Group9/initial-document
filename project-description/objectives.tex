\subsubsection*{Requirements}
The MCU subsystem should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Read local sensor data (e.g. sunlight, soil moisture, temperature)
    \item Adjust parameters of local modules (e.g. shade, water, nutrients)
    \item Interpret user settings and adjust parameters of modules accordingly
    \item Fulfill web requirements with at least two computers/controllers
\end{itemize}
It would be nice for the MCU subsystem to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fulfill web requirements with one computer/controller
    \item Have a local user display (e.g. LCD, dot matrix, segmented)
\end{itemize}
The direction of power in this system:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Power generated through a wall outlet
  \item AC/DC converter 
  \item Power supply
  \item MCU
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Regulators
    \item Sensors
    \item Mechanics
    \item CPU
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
It would be nice to have:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Solar power, with the flow of power as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Solar panels 
    \item Solar power bank 
    \item Power supply 
    \item MCU
  \end{itemize}
  \item Use the solar panels as blinds to be able to open and close as well as collect energy
\end{itemize}
The Sensing Capabilities of the project should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Infrared Spectroscopy Sensor which detects:
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Soil Moisture
            \item Soil Temperature
            \item Soil OH group content (acidity)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Infrared Spectra signal processing
\end{itemize}
It would be nice to have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scanning Capabilities for checking various parts of the garden bed
    \item Soil Nutrient Estimation and other variables possible via IR Spectroscopy
\end{itemize}
The web component of the project should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Attach to a weather API to receive:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rain
        \item Sun light
        \item Temperature
        \item Frost warnings
        \item Humidity
    \end{itemize}
    \item Alert users of conditions outside of automatic control (i.e. soil composition and frost)
    \item Change control parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sun light
        \item Water
        \item Soil parameters
    \end{itemize}
    \item Have an intuitive user interface
    \item Communicate with the MCU
\end{itemize}
It would be nice to have the web component:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set control parameters based on presets for plants
    \item Get plant data from the web to pass to MCU
    \item Communicate over secure channels
\end{itemize}

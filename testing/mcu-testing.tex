\subsection{Controller Subsystem Testing}
\label{sec:controller_subsystem_testing}
The MCU subsystem underwent a littany of testing. The electrical
characteristics, as well as hardware and software behavior were tested to
ensure a working product. Any use of "system" or "the system" in this section refers exclusively to, and the entirety of the MCU subsystem.

% Electrical characteristics (to see what it can handle and what it uses)
\subsubsection{Electrical Characteristics}
The MCU subsystem adheres to the following electrical characteristics
related to power draw and voltage input in the following states. Unless noted,
all voltages will be in direct current, and all conditions will be tested at
room temperature (77 $\degree$F). 

\paragraph{General Requirements} The system is able to accept a voltage
of -0.5 to 3.8 V into V\textsubscript{BAT}, -0.5 to 4.3 V into any digital
IO-configured pin, -0.5 to 2.1 V into any RF-configured pin, and -0.5 to 2.1 V
into any analog-configured pin without damage. The system is able to
accept a current of 0 to 620 mA into any pin without damage. The system shall
be able to regulate voltage going into V\textsubscript{BAT}, and provide 3.3 $\pm$ 0.3 V
on its 3V3 rail to any components in the sensing
subsystem that may require it.
\subparagraph{Results} Verified via Texas Instruments' documentation.

nominally within the temperature range of 30 to 140 $\degree$F. Crystal
oscillators shall fall within the thermal drift ratings provided in the
MCU technical reference material.
\subparagraph{Results} Verified via Texas Instruments' documentation.

\paragraph{Shutdown Power Draw} The system shall not draw more than 10
$\upmu$A in shut down mode. The system shall not consume more than 100
$\upmu$W in shut down mode.
\subparagraph{Results} Because power is completely cut off to the system to initiate shutdown mode, no power is drawn from the system. This has been verified.

\paragraph{Active Power Draw} The system shall not draw more than 150 mA while
receiving or idling in active mode, and shall not draw more than 300
mA while transmitting in active mode. The system shall not consume more
than 750 mW while receiving or idling in active mode, and shall not
consume more than 1.50 W while transmitting in active mode. The system
is able to sufficiently power any components in the sensing subsystem in
active mode.
\subparagraph{Results} The system is able to sufficiently power other components and subsystems during normal operation.

\paragraph{Startup Power Draw} The system shall not draw more than 750 mA
within the first 20 seconds of powering on or starting up the system. The
system shall not consume more than 4.00 W within the first 20 seconds of
powering on or starting up the system.
\subparagraph{Results} Unverified.

\paragraph{Solar Panels and Battery System} The system is able to
operate nominally solely powered off of the solar and battery subsystem
detailed in \autoref{sec:power_subsystem}. The system shall not require any
external power to operate in any modes (e.g. startup, active, etc.).
\subparagraph{Results} Moot, as our product moved to being an AC-line powered system.

% Hardware behavior (ability to set and use peripherals n stuff)
\subsubsection{Hardware Behavior}
The MCU subsystem shall pass the following tests related to use of the
MCU's onboard hardware, peripherals, and supported operations. The
programming developed and test the below criteria will be intended to only
perform testing on the below modules, and may or may not be present in the
product software build.

\paragraph{Upload Programming} The developers is able to successfully
upload programming (software) that meets the requirements detailed in
\autoref{sec:controller_subsystem}. The developers is able to

Programming uploaded to the MCU shall execute either upon powering the
system, upon command, or when executing an ISR to start up the system.
\subparagraph{Results} Verified.

\paragraph{I2C} The developers is able to initialize I2C. I2C shall
function nominally if used for communication with any other modules in the
overall garden bed system.
\subparagraph{Results} Verified.

\paragraph{Onboard LEDs} The system is able to make use of its onboard
LEDs for notifying the user or developers of system states according to the specification in \autoref{sec:controller_subsystem}.
\subparagraph{Results} Verified.

\paragraph{WiFi Module} The WiFi module shall conform to the 802.11b/g/n
standards. The developers is able to configure the WiFi
module to support 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n in WiFi station mode.  The 
developers is able to configure the WiFi module to support 802.11b, or
802.11g in WiFi Direct mode. The WiFi module shall allow the system to
connect to either an open WLAN, or a WLAN secured by WPA2 (Personal or
Enterprise). While
connected, the WiFi module is capable of sending and receiving
data at speeds of at least 10 kbps at least 80\% of the time.
\subparagraph{Results} Verified.

\paragraph{Interrupts/ISRs} The developers is able to configure
the interrupts available on the MCU as described by technical reference
documentation to trigger an ISR of their choice. ISRs shall run within 1 second
of triggering the interrupt linked to the specific ISR. An empty ISR shall
return the MCU to its previous state before the interrupt (i.e. clear any
flags and return any registers to their previous state).

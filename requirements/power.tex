\subsection{Power}
\subsubsection{Minimum Viable Product}
The direction of power in this system:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Power generated through a wall outlet
  \item AC/DC converter 
  \item Power supply
  \item MCU
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Regulators
    \item Sensors
    \item Mechanics
    \item CPU
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Stretch}
It would be nice to have:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Solar power, with the flow of power as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Solar panels 
    \item Solar power bank 
    \item Power supply 
    \item MCU
  \end{itemize}
  \item Use the solar panels as blinds to be able to open and close as well as collect energy
\end{itemize}

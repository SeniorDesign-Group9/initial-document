\subsection{Controller Subsystem Testing}
\label{sec:controller_subsystem_testing}
The MCU subsystem will undergo a littany of testing. The electrical
characteristics, as well as hardware and software behavior will be tested to
ensure a working product. Any use of "system" or "the system" refers
exclusively to, and the entirety of the MCU subsystem.

% Electrical characteristics (to see what it can handle and what it uses)
\subsubsection{Electrical Characteristics}
The MCU subsystem should adhere to the following electrical characteristics
related to power draw and voltage input in the following states. Unless noted,
all voltages will be in direct current, and all conditions will be tested at
room temperature (77 $\degree$F). 

\paragraph{General Requirements} The system should be able to accept a voltage
of -0.5 to 3.8 V into V\textsubscript{BAT}, -0.5 to 4.3 V into any digital
IO-configured pin, -0.5 to 2.1 V into any RF-configured pin, and -0.5 to 2.1 V
into any analog-configured pin without damage. The system should be able to
accept a current of 0 to 620 mA into any pin without damage. The system should
be able to regulate voltage going into V\textsubscript{BAT}, and provide 3.3 V

external power to operate in any modes (e.g. startup, active, etc.).

% Hardware behavior (ability to set and use peripherals n stuff)
\subsubsection{Hardware Behavior}
The MCU subsystem should pass the following tests related to use of the
CC3220's onboard hardware, peripherals, and supported operations. The
programming developed and test the below criteria will be intended to only
perform testing on the below modules, and may or may not be present in the
product software build.

\paragraph{Upload Programming} The developers should be able to successfully
upload programming (software) that meets the requirements detailed in
\autoref{sec:controller_subsystem}. The developers should be able to
successfully upload programming that allows and/or performs unit testing
(as detailed in this section, \autoref{sec:controller_subsystem_testing}).
Programming uploaded to the CC3220 should execute either upon powering the
system, upon command, or when executing an ISR to start up the system.

\paragraph{I2C} The developers should be able to initialize I2C. I2C should
function nominally if used for communication with any other modules in the
overall garden bed system.

\paragraph{Onboard LEDs} The system should be able to make use of its onboard
LEDs for notifying the user or developers of system states. 
When the system is in active mode, the green LED shall be solidly illuminated.
When the system is in low power mode, the green LED shall flash 1 time for a
period of 0.5 seconds, every 2 seconds. When the system is in critical power
mode, the red LED shall flash 2 times for a period of 0.5 seconds per flash,
seperated by 1 second between each flash, every 30 seconds. When the system is
in shutdown mode, no LEDs shall be active. When the system is starting up, the
green and red LED shall be solidly illuminated until the startup sequence is
completed and the system transitions into a different power mode. The yellow
LED shall solidly illuminate while receiving data through the RF antenna for
the duration of the reception.
The yellow LED shall blink 1 time every 0.2 seconds for a period of 0.1 second
while transmitting data through the RF antenna for the duration of the
transmission.

\paragraph{Watchdog Timer} The developers should be able to initialize the
watchdog timer. When the watchdog timer reaches zero, the watchdog module
shall trigger an interrupt. The ISR triggered by the interrupt shall
reset the watchdog timer. In the case the ISR is not able to be triggered by
the interrupt (e.g. system freeze), the watchdog module shall reset the system.
After the system is reset by the watchdog module, it shall start up normally
(i.e. in a way that does not functionally differ from a regular startup).

\paragraph{WiFi Module} The WiFi module should conform to the 802.11b/g/n
standards. The developers should be able to configure the WiFi
module to support 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n in WiFi station mode.  The 
developers should be able to configure the WiFi module to support 802.11b, or
802.11g in WiFi Direct mode. The WiFi module shall allow the system to
connect to either an open WLAN, or a WLAN secured by WPA2 (Personal or
Enterprise). The MCU shall connect to a WLAN via a hardcoded password (and
username, if needed), or via SmartConfig. The system shall receive an IPv4
address via DHCP, or it shall be able to be statically assigned. While
connected, the WiFi module shall be capable of sending and receiving
data at speeds of at least 10 kbps at least 80\% of the time.

\paragraph{GPIO} The developers shall be able to configure the GPIO pins to
the configurations available as described by technical reference documentation.
The developers shall be able to set the state of the desired GPIO pins to
the configurations available as described by technical reference documentation.

\paragraph{Interrupts/ISRs} The developers shall be able to configure
the interrupts available on the CC3220 as described by technical reference
documentation to trigger an ISR of their choice. ISRs shall run within 1 second
of triggering the interrupt linked to the specific ISR. An empty ISR shall
return the CC3220 to its previous state before the interrupt (i.e. clear any
flags and return any registers to their previous state).

\paragraph{ADC} The developers shall be able to configure the ADC on the CC3220
to adhere to the parameters described in the technical reference documentation.
The ADC shall be able to measure signals with a voltage of between 0 and 1.8 V.
The ADC shall be able to accurately measure a voltage level down to a
resolution of $\leq$1 mV. The ADC shall be able to measure at a sampling rate
of $\geq$50 kilosamples per second per channel. The ADC shall support
conversion on up to 4 channels. The ADC shall support the ablility to timestamp
samples with the clock mentioned by the technical reference documentation.

\paragraph{Reset Button} The reset button shall be configured, or be
configurable to "power cycle" the system. The reset button shall not erase
any programming uploaded to the CC3220. The reset button shall not keep the
system from starting for more than 1 second after the button has been released.

\paragraph{Startup} The system shall not take longer than 10 seconds to begin
its programming upon sufficient power delivery to the CC3220 as described by
the by the technical reference documentation. The system shall not perform
the programmed startup sequence unless interrupted to do so, or if given
sufficient power as described by the by the technical reference documentation
after being shut down.

\paragraph{Processor} The central processor of the CC3220 shall maintain at
least a 20 MHz clock speed while in active mode.

\paragraph{Memory} The programming uploaded to the CC3220 shall not take up
more than 64 KB of space in memory.

\subsubsection{Web Technologies}
\paragraph{Docker}
``Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run modern applications. We handle the tedious setup, so you can focus on the code.'' This quote comes directly from Docker's website on why developers should switch to Docker. This technology makes items more portable by making the executable platform agnostic through the use of a docker kernel and containers. The figure below should provide some clarity:

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Docker Architecture.png}
    \label{fig:docker_arch}
\end{figure}
A developer can program applications such as those demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:docker_arch}, package them into images and run them in containers. Docker works with the OS kernel to provide the same environment to the application each and everytime.

One of the largest advantages to using and implementing Docker that the team sees is that one team member can program and package the image and it should ``just run'' on any other team member's machine. This fact will prove very useful in integration testing especially for the socket server detailed in Section \ref{sec:web_subsystem}.
\paragraph{User Interface}
Because these are web technologies we will be using Javascript frontend frameworks/libraries for creating the frontend. Based upon cursory research, the most feature-rich and most widely used are React and VueJS.
\subparagraph{React}
React is a component-based library for building user interfaces.  Many libraries have extended the functionality by adding components to React for use by other developers. A React component is a stateful element in the Document Object Model (DOM). Essentially, based on the state information, a component is rendered in raw HTML to the browser. One such example of a component library is MaterialUI (MUI). MUI is a popular library for adding components like hamburger menus, tables, graphs, etc. Choosing React decreases the time spent developing due to the ease of tossing boilerplate components at the problem. The biggest issue is that all rendering is done in the browser which means that loading an uncached page may take a long time. Frameworks built ontop of React such as NextJS help speed up this process by moving some of the processing to the server.
\subparagraph{VueJS}
VueJS is a framework for building user interfaces. The difference between a library and a framework is that a framework provides a control flow while libraries are just used. VueJS is not too unlike raw HTML and JavaScript wherein \verb|<script>| tags are used to create dynamic pages in response to user actions. The key difference between Vue and the above is that Vue provides the access to component-based programming. Similar to React, Vue works on the basic of components but it uses the default HTML DOM and adds functionality to pre-existing components. This comes with the limitation that components are not nearly as interleaved with data from a web server. Vue is performant and designed for single-page applications, which may not server this project well in the long-run.
\paragraph{Web and Socket Server}
This section will host information related to technologies for building out a web and socket server for connecting the user interface to the backend. .NET, Java and JavaScript all have reasonable solutions to these but based on the JavaScript user interface, this discussion will be kept to Java and JavaScript solutions and technologies.
\subparagraph{Java Spring Boot}
Java Spring Boot is a full featured library that has different webservers embedded such as Apache Tomcat. Web servers are the means for which an application can be accessed from the outside world. Java Spring Boot makes this process incredibly easy. Part of this project will be communicating via TCP packets as well as through HTTP requests. Java at first glance seems like the easier way of accomplishing both tasks through the \verb|java.net| libraries and through the use of Spring Boot \verb|@Controller|.

The \verb|java.net| libraries are essentially a port of the network protocols that were made in the C language for creating communications via packets. By deploying using Java Spring Boot, it is possible to create two services packaged into one, the socket server and the web server. Java's memory management and VM environment leave a lot to be desired. The current state of the language and its artifact leave a lot to be desired as well. Because of the nature of running as a server and potentially servicing multiple plant beds, Java's lack of callbacks and lacking multi-threading support means it is downgraded given its overhead.

The \verb|@Controller| is such a great feature in Spring Boot. Java is strictly typed, leading to a lot really helpful features in executing backend requests. Also, because of the overhead, Java ORMs tend to be more fully featured and have support for a variety of other tools that increase velocity when programming. One such tool is Liquibase. Liquibase is a database changelog tool for creating and implementing database migrations based on a code.

\subparagraph{ExpressJS}
Express is a lightweight backend framework for implementing routes and middleware in JavaScript. The biggest disadvantage of using

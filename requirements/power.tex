\subsubsection{Minimum Viable Product}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Power generated through a wall outlet
  \item Moves through an AC/DC converter 
  \item Then into the power supply to get dispersed throughout the MCU 
  \item Power is collected through solar panels
  \item From the solar panels through a solar power bank 
  \item Then into the power supply to get dispersed throughout the MCU
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Controller Subsystem Testing}
\label{sec:controller_subsystem_testing}
The MCU subsystem will undergo a littany of testing. The electrical
characteristics, as well as hardware and software behavior will be tested to
ensure a working product. Any use of "system" or "the system" refers
exclusively to, and the entirety of the MCU subsystem.

% Electrical characteristics (to see what it can handle and what it uses)
\subsubsection{Electrical Characteristics}
The MCU subsystem should adhere to the following electrical characteristics
related to power draw and voltage input in the following states. Unless noted,
all voltages will be in direct current, and all conditions will be tested at
room temperature (77 $\degree$F). 

\paragraph{General Requirements} The system should be able to accept a voltage
of -0.5 to 3.8 V into V\textsubscript{BAT}, -0.5 to 4.3 V into any digital
IO-configured pin, -0.5 to 2.1 V into any RF-configured pin, and -0.5 to 2.1 V
into any analog-configured pin without damage. The system should be able to
accept a current of 0 to 620 mA into any pin without damage. The system should
be able to regulate voltage going into V\textsubscript{BAT}, and provide 3.3 V
(between 3.0 and 3.6 V) on its 3V3 rail to any components in the sensing
subsystem that may require it.

\paragraph{Operating Temperature} The system should be able to operate
nominally within the temperature range of 30 to 140 $\degree$F. Crystal
oscillators shall fall within the thermal drift ratings provided in the
CC3220 technical reference material.

\paragraph{Shutdown Power Draw} The system should not draw more than 10
$\upmu$A in shut down mode. The system should not consume more than 100
$\upmu$W in shut down mode.

\paragraph{Critical Power Draw} The system should not draw more than 1 mA in
critical power mode. The system should not consume more than 5 mW in critical
power mode.

\paragraph{Low Power Draw} The system should not draw more than 100 mA while
receiving or idling in low power mode, and should not draw more than 250
mA while transmitting in low power mode. The system should not consume more
than 500 mW while receiving or idling in low power mode, and should not
consume more than 1.25 W while transmitting in low power mode. The system
should be able to sufficiently power any components in the sensing subsystem in
low power mode.

\paragraph{Active Power Draw} The system should not draw more than 150 mA while
receiving or idling in active mode, and should not draw more than 300
mA while transmitting in active mode. The system should not consume more
than 750 mW while receiving or idling in active mode, and should not
consume more than 1.50 W while transmitting in active mode. The system
should be able to sufficiently power any components in the sensing subsystem in
active mode.

\paragraph{Startup Power Draw} The system should not draw more than 750 mA
within the first 20 seconds of powering on or starting up the system. The
system should not consume more than 4.00 W within the first 20 seconds of
powering on or starting up the system.

\paragraph{Solar Panels and Battery System} The system should be able to
operate nominally solely powered off of the solar and battery subsystem
detailed in \autoref{sec:power_subsystem}. The system should not require any
external power to operate in any modes (e.g. startup, active, etc.).

% Hardware behavior (ability to set and use peripherals n stuff)
\subsubsection{Hardware Behavior}
The MCU subsystem should pass the following tests related to use of the
CC3220's onboard hardware, peripherals, and supported operations.

\paragraph{Upload Programming} The developers should be able to successfully
upload programming (software) that meets the requirements detailed in
\autoref{sec:controller_subsystem}. The developers should be able to
successfully upload programming that allows and/or performs unit testing
(as detailed in this section, \autoref{sec:controller_subsystem_testing}).
Programming uploaded to the CC3220 should execute either upon powering the
system, upon command, or when executing an ISR to start up the system.

\paragraph{I2C} The developers should be able to initialize I2C. I2C should
function nominally if used for communication with any other modules in the
overall garden bed system.

\paragraph{Onboard LEDs} The system should be able to make use of its onboard
LEDs for notifying the user or developers of system states. 
When the system is in active mode, the green LED shall be solidly illuminated.
When the system is in low power mode, the green LED shall flash 1 time for a
period of 0.5 seconds, every 2 seconds. When the system is in critical power
mode, the red LED shall flash 2 times for a period of 0.5 seconds per flash,
seperated by 1 second between each flash, every 30 seconds. When the system is
in shutdown mode, no LEDs shall be active. When the system is starting up, the
green and red LED shall be solidly illuminated until the startup sequence is
completed and the system transitions into a different power mode. The yellow
LED shall solidly illuminate while receiving data through the RF antenna for
the duration of the reception.
The yellow LED shall blink 1 time every 0.2 seconds for a period of 0.1 second
while transmitting data through the RF antenna for the duration of the
transmission.

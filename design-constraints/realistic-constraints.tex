Although different sponsorship options were explored as a source of
funding for our product, ultimately our team has not received any
sponsorship for this product. This process will be entirely
self-funded and evenly divided between the four team members. As a

factor. It follows that the parts selected for this endeavor will meet
the minimum requirements, but may not have some of the "nice-to-have"
features one may want from a specific component.

\subsection{Goals}

The system is divided into four subsystems that reflect each of the team memberâ€™s specialties. The Goals Table lists the system goals in three categories: core goals, stretch goals, and advance goals. Subsystems are grouped, except when they are split up by goal category. In addition, each goal corresponds to a tagline, for reference in the Objectives Table below.

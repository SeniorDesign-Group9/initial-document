\subsection{Controller Subsystem Testing}
\label{sec:controller_subsystem_testing}
The MCU subsystem will undergo a littany of testing. The electrical and
logical characteristics, as well as software behavior will be tested to ensure
a working product.

% Electrical characteristics (to see what it can handle and what it uses)
\paragraph{Electrical Characteristics}
Shutoff current testing \\
Hibernate current testing \\
Low power current testing \\
Active current testing \\
Shutoff voltage testing \\
Hibernate voltage testing \\
Low power voltage testing \\
Active voltage testing \\

% Logical characteristics (ability to set and use peripherals n stuff)
\paragraph{Logical Characteristics}
Upload code \\
